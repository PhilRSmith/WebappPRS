Current Progress:
- React Client built
- Server Frame built
- Established connection to mongoDB atlas
- Can load pages/images from the DB onto the webpage (server endpoints made, basic api)
- Established browsing links to each page in the DB from the frontend (that is to say potential comics should now be individually viewable)
- Added in user login/token system for regular users and admins
- Added comic upload feature for administrators
- Deployed test version to ec2 at: http://ec2-3-21-56-228.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

Next Steps:
